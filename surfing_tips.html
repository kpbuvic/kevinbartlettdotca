             I am a reasonably competent surfer, but new enough to
             the sport that I remember what it was like to be a complete
             beginner. Here are some tips I wish I had been given when I
             was just getting started: 
           </p>

        <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">
          <b>Start with a longboard.</b> You'll want a 9-foot or even a
          10-foot board for learning. If you're very small, you might
          get away with an 8-footer, but whatever you do, don't get a
          6'1" potato chip just because all your friends are
          shortboarders or because the guy behind the counter at the
          surf shop thinks longboards are uncool. You'll catch more
          waves, enjoy yourself more and learn much more quickly on a
          longboard. Even a second-hand longboard will likely be
          expensive, but that just means you'll almost certainly be able
          to sell it for the same price <b>if</b> you decide to switch to a
          shorter board (despite what some people think, longboards
          aren't "training wheels" for riding waves&mdash;some of the most skillful
          surfers I have ever seen were riding longboards).
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">
          <b>Pop-up method.</b> A lot of people will tell you should "pop up
          in one smooth motion". This is by far the least useful piece
          of advice given to beginner surfers, and you should ignore
          it completely. Break your pop-up down into three distinct
          steps:
        </li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">
            Place your hands on the board in front of you and do a
            push up. All of your weight is now supported by your hands
            and by the tips of your toes, just as in a regular push
            up. Rather than keeping your back straight, however, you
            should arch it so that only your upper body is elevated;
            your pelvis should remain more or less planted on the
            board. 
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">
            <p>
              Keeping your hands firmly on the surfboard, bring your
              knees up to your chest, so that your feet swing in under
              your body like a pendulum. You want your feet to end up
              pointing somewhat across the board, with your left foot in
              front and your right foot behind (reverse this if you are
              "goofy-footed").
            </p>
            <p>
              The key point to keep in mind in this step is that your
              feet move forward to be under your body, rather than your
              body moving back to be over your feet. A rearward shift of
              weight on a surfboard puts the brakes on, allowing the
              wave to overtake you. If you find yourself kneeling on
              your surfboard at any point during your popup, you are
              probably making this mistake, rocking your hips back to be
              over your knees, causing your surfboard to slow
              down. Avoid this mistake by remembering these important
              words of wisdom: <em>"bum low, head high"</em>.
            </p> 
            <p>
              If you find yourself making an A-frame of your body, legs straight,
              bent at the waist, with both your hands and feet on the board, it is
              because you have straightened your legs before you should have. Keep
              your knees bent until your feet are under your body.
            </p> 
            <p>
              Note that this step SHOULD be performed in one smooth
              motion.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">
            <p>
              You should now be in a deep crouch, with your hands still
              planted on your board. Stand up (this step is optional).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          So why do people say you should pop up "in one smooth motion"?
          Because that's how it <em>feels</em> when you put it all together on a steep
          wave. Watch people surfing for a while, though; you'll notice that
          on gentler waves&mdash;the kind you should be learning on&mdash;surfers will
          often hold the arched-back push-up position for a second or two to
          be sure they have caught the wave before completing their
          pop-ups. Evidently, breaking the popup down into discrete steps is
          not just a mental exercise for learning purposes, but an actual,
          functional technique as well.

        <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">
          <p>
            <b>Paddle smarter, not harder.</b> The second most useless
            piece of advice given to beginners is "paddle harder!"
            Sure, you have to paddle hard to get a wave, especially
            when you lack the judgement and manoeuverability needed to
            be at the wave's sweet spot at just the right time, but
            come on&mdash;you're already paddling harder than any of the
            experienced surfers out there. What you need to do is
            paddle the right way, using your body posture to adjust
            your fore-and-aft weight distribution at certain, critical
            moments. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When you see a wave coming, start paddling to get up a bit of
            speed. Just before the wave gets to you, keep paddling steadily, but
            adjust your weight distribution backwards by arching your back, moving
            your head and shoulders as far up and back as you can (watch some
            shortboarders sometime to see how they do it). Just as the wave
            catches up to you, and you feel your speed starting to increase, throw
            your body down onto the board, simultaneously reaching one arm forward
            for a final, extremely vigorous stroke (once you have caught the wave,
            you may have to arch your back again to avoid digging the nose of your
            board into the bottom of the wave).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I find that throwing my weight forward in this manner is
            far more effective than simply paddling harder. This
            explains how an experienced surfer can sometimes catch a
            wave with a single stroke, while a furiously windmilling
            beginner just falls off the back of the same wave. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">
          <p>
            <b>Don't grab the rails when popping up.</b> I already mentioned
            this, but it is worth repeating here as a separate tip:
            when popping up, place your hands flat on the board in
            front of you, rather than grabbing the rails. There is a
            tendency for beginners to cling to their boards like grim
            death rather than popping up when they slide down the face
            of a wave, and having a firm grip on the board will make
            this all the more likely. Later, when you are a good
            surfer, grabbing the rails may be useful in some
            circumstances, but it can hold you back when you're
            learning. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The final two points are safety tips:
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">
          <b>Fall flat.</b> Just as you should always assume a gun you are
          handling is loaded, assume that the water below you is
          shallow and full of sharp rocks or coral. Head-first falls
          should definitely be avoided. 
        </li>
        
        <li style="margin-bottom:8px;">
          <b>Always be ready to turn turtle.</b> "Turning
          turtle"&mdash;grabbing the sides of your surfboard and
          capsizing it&mdash;is useful for getting under
          waves. It is also useful for avoiding being hit by another surfer who
          is getting too close. Don't wait to find out if you are going to be
          hit; turn turtle right away if you are in any doubt at all. 
        </li>
      </ol>
