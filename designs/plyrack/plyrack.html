             This is my design for a rack for storing surfboards and
             windsurfers. It has several advantages over other systems
             I've seen:
             <ul>
               <li>It is freestanding&mdash;no holes need to be drilled in your walls, and it fits in any room.</li>
               <li>It stores your boards horizontally&mdash;this is important if you have low ceilings and/or long boards.</li>
               <li>It folds flat&mdash;for storage and moving.</li>
             </ul>
           </p>

             It took me about 5 hours to make the rack (or rather it
             would have if I hadn't been designing it as I went along)
             and cost me US$38 for materials.

             <ul>
               <li>One sheet of ¾" plywood or two half-sheets (do not
               use particle board&mdash;it will swell and crumble if it gets wet);</li>
               <li>Wood glue;</li>
               <li>Four 3" hinges</li>
               <li>Twenty-four ½" wood screws (for the hinges);</li>
               <li>Five 1¼" screws.</li>
             </ul>

             <h2>Tools</h2>
             <ul>
               <li>Electric jigsaw with thin blades;</li>
               <li>Screwdriver</li>

             It's also nice to have a circular saw for some of the
             straight cuts, but you can make do with the jigsaw if you
             don't mind a few wiggly edges. A jigsaw can be made to
             cut straight lines if you clamp a straight-edge to the
             plywood and use it as a guide for the saw.

             <h2>Instructions</h2>
           </p>
           <p>
             <b>Step 1: </b>
               Look at
               <a href="figure-1-metric-grid.html" target="_blank">figure 1</a>
                and draw shape "A" onto your plywood. There are two versions of figure 1,
               one with a
               <a href="figure-1-metric-grid.html" target="_blank">metric</a>
               grid superimposed on the shapes,
               the other with a
               <a href="figure-1-non-metric-grid.html" target="_blank">non-metric</a>
               grid superimposed (the
               plywood shapes were designed using centimetres, so it
               is probably easiest to use the metric version). When
               drawing shape "A", use the blue dots in figure 1 as
               guides to draw out an angular version of the shape,
               then round off the sharp edges by drawing smooth
               curves. The rounded edges are aesthetically pleasing,
               but more importantly, rounding off the corners on the
               undersides of the shape's "arms" should give them a bit
               more strength. The notch on the base of shape "A" is
               designed to interlock with a similar notch in another
               piece of plywood; you want a snug fit, so for now,
               measure the notch to be somewhat less than ¾" wide. 
           </p>
           <p>
               <b>Step 2: </b>Cut out shape "A" from the plywood. It
               is easy to overshoot corners with the jigsaw,
               particularly if your blade is a bit wide, so be
               careful. Again, make sure you don't make the notch in
               the base too wide&mdash;you can always widen it later. 
           </p>
           <p>
               <b>Step 3: </b>Use shape "A" as a template to trace
               shape "B" onto your plywood, then cut shape "B" out. 
           </p>
           <p>
             <b>Step 4: </b>
               Look at
               <a href="figure-2-metric-grid.html" target="_blank">figure 2</a>
               and draw out shapes "C", "D" and "E" on your plywood. As with figure 1,
               there are two versions of figure 2, one with a
               <a href="figure-2-metric-grid.html" target="_blank">metric</a>
               grid superimposed on the shapes, the other with a
               <a href="figure-2-non-metric-grid.html" target="_blank">non-metric</a>
               grid superimposed.
           </p>
           <p>
               <b>Step 5: </b>Cut out shapes "C", "D" and "E", using a
               circular saw, if you have one. Shapes "C" and "D" are
               straightforward, but shape "E" requires a bit more
               care. As with shapes "A" and "B", the notches in shape
               "E" should be made somewhat narrower than ¾" at
               first. It is important to cut out only one of the
               notches in shape "E" for now; the exact placement of
               the second notch will depend on the size of the hinges
               you bought and the accuracy of your other cuts. 
           </p>
           <p>
               <b>Step 6: </b>Assemble the rack. Attach shape "D" to shape "A" as in
               <a href="figure-3.html" target="_blank">figure 3</a>
               , using the 1¼" screws and some
               wood glue (shape "D" allows the entire rack to fold up
               flat when it is completed). Next, screw the hinges onto
               the edges of shape "C". Finally, use the hinges to
               attach shape "C" to shapes "B" and "D". Note that the
               hinges attach to the surfaces of the verticals, rather
               than to their edges. If the hinge barrels are of large
               diameter, it may be necessary to gouge out little
               trenches for them with a chisel or a screwdriver in
               order to make the hinges lie reasonably flat. 
           </p>
           <p>
               <b>Step 7: </b>Step 7: Attach the cross-brace (shape
               "E"). The notches in the cross-brace interlock with
               those on shapes "A" and "B", but at this point, only
               one of the notches on the cross-brace should have been
               cut. First, widen this notch and the one on the
               corresponding upright support (shape "A" or "B") as
               necessary to get the two pieces to interlock
               snugly. Then, with shapes "A" and "B" parallel,
               determine the correct location for the second notch in
               the cross-brace and make the cut. You may want to cut a
               length off one or the other end of the cross-brace to
               make it symmetrical.
